# Opentrons Game Board

A game board sticker approach can be a fun and engaging way to familiarize youth with Opentrons protocols prior to them getting on the computer and learning Opentrons Python. The look and feel of the Opentrons software can be mimicked in paper designs. How might protocols for looping, dilution and plate mapping be instructed in a sticker gameboard? (Translucent stickers might work for dilution). Using blank cards representing the 96 well format, youth can design dispensing and dilution protocols for each other to tryout. What other steps of Opentrons might be approached in this way? I can imagine that this could also be designed as a Scratch game.
